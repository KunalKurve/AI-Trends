1. Spark SQL is having dependency on Hive Metastore
2. Hive MetaStore is having dependency on Hadoop
3. Hadoop is made up of 
  1) HDFS (Storage)
  2) YARN (Cluster Resource Manager)
  3) MR (Distributed Programming Framework)

4. HDFS (Storage) is having following daemon processes
   NameNode, DataNode, SecondaryNameNode

YARN (Cluster Resource Manager) is having following daemon processes
 ResourceManager, NodeManager

MR (Distributed Programming Framework) wont have any daemon processes



Sequence will be
1.Start HDFS
2.Start YARN
3.Start Hive Metastore
4.Implement Start SQL applications
